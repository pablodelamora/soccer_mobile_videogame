# soccer_mobile_videogame
This is a working project about a videogame for mobile in Unity. The game is called Rondo.

This game is inspired in the soccer training exercise Rondo where there is people in the middle trying to steal the ball from the people around them.

This game was created by Pablo de la Mora and is still in development.
